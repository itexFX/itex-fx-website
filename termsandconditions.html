If you provide incorrect beneficiary details or you confirm incorrect beneficiary details contained in this e-mail we will not be liable for any loss you incur, although we will use reasonable efforts to assist you in the recovery of your payment; we reserve the right to charge you a fee to cover our reasonable costs for doing this. To send a payment we may use third party intermediaries to complete the money transfer to a recipient if the recipient does not have an Account and the intermediary shall then be responsible for ensuring the onward transmission of the payment to the recipient and our obligations under these Terms of Use for the onward transmission of funds shall be complete once such funds have been credited by us to the account of the relevant intermediary. We will not be liable for losses that result from such third party charges or fees being applied to your payment Subject to the Regulations we may refuse your payment Instruction because for example you have not satisfied your obligations under these Terms of Use or we reasonably believe the payment to be unlawful. In these circumstances we shall promptly notify you using your supplied contact details, stating wherever possible the reasons for our refusal, and the procedure for rectifying any payment detail errors that led to the refusal but we reserve the right to charge you a fee to cover our reasonable costs for doing this. We are not obliged to notify you of our refusal to execute the proposed transaction where we reasonably believe that such a notification would be unlawful. If we receive a payment Instruction by 4.30pm on a Business Day, your payment Instruction will be deemed to have been received by us on that Business Day. If your payment Instruction is received after by 4.30pm or on a day that is not a Business Day, your payment instruction will be deemed to have been received on the next Business Day. Your payment instruction will be acted on the earliest possible payment date available once the Contract has been performed unless you have requested a specific future date. 9. Receiving Payment. If you receive funds into your Account, we will send you a notification e-mail and display the payment in your transactions history. You should regularly reconcile incoming payments with your own records. You should be aware that receipt of funds to your Account does not necessarily mean that these transactions cannot be reversed. We reserve the right to reverse a payment in case the payer or the payer’s bank or payment service provider has reversed (or is reasonably likely to reverse) an upload or other payment which was used to fund the payment to you. 10. Prohibited Payment. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion to impose ‘acceptable use’ terms in relation to the operation of your Account and the provision of any payment service including the prohibition of certain categories of payment transactions for example payments in relation to the gaming, bitcoins and virtual currencies sectors by specifying these on the Website. You must not use your Account for any illegal purposes including without limitation fraud and money laundering. We will report any suspicious activity to the relevant law enforcement agency.

Withdrawing Fund. You can request a withdrawal of all or part of the funds held in your Account at any time by logging into your Account and following the relevant instructions. We do not guarantee the use of any particular withdrawal method and may make changes to or discontinue the acceptance of any particular withdrawal method at any time as long as there is at least one withdrawal method available to you. You may only make a withdrawal to a bank account and where you are the named holder of such bank account. For the purposes of a withdrawal transaction, we are a payer and not a payment service provider. You must ensure that the payment details you enter when withdrawing funds are correct and complete. We will not be liable for funds being sent to the wrong payment instrument where this is due to you providing incorrect payment details. If you have withdrawn funds to the wrong payment details payment instrument, you may request that we assist you in reclaiming the funds, however, we will charge you an administration fee and we cannot guarantee that the reclaim efforts will be successful. 12. Safeguarding.Funds received in accordance with a payment instruction will be subject to the segregation requirements as set out in the Regulations and are referred to as “Relevant Fund”. For the purposes of this clause “Relevant Fund” means sums received from you or for your benefit from a payment service provider such as a bank for the execution of Payment Services on your behalf. Relevant Funds are held in segregated bank accounts which are independent of our business bank accounts. The purpose for so holding funds is to ensure that in the event of our insolvency, or if a financial claim is made against us, no creditor or claimant should be able to claim funds held in these accounts. This is because no other person or institution may have any rights or interest over the funds held in these accounts such as a lien over funds in these accounts. Relevant Funds are not covered under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Relevant Funds do not include funds received from or to you or on your behalf in settlement of a Contract. When you transfer funds to us to pay Margin Call(s) full ownership and title to these funds transfers to us absolutely and such funds are considered as our funds. They will not be Relevant Funds and so they will placed into our business bank account and will not be afforded protection under the segregation rules of the Regulations. Pursuant to the Regulations, we will not pay interest on funds paid to us including balances held in segregated or client bank accounts and we may retain, for our own benefit, any interest which accrues from funds held in any accounts
